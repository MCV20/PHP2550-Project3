Project 3: Evaluating model predictive performance across simulated populations.


Welcome to the README for the cardiovascular risk prediction model analysis within the NHANES dataset and simulated populations. This study delved into assessing the model's performance, uncovering nuanced insights. Notably, gender-based disparities emerged, revealing better predictive outcomes in men, potentially owing to a healthier male cohort within the NHANES data. However, the analysis of simulated NHANES data portrayed challenges in transporting the model, particularly for women, despite achieving precise estimations with low standard errors. This observation underscores the complexities in replicating model efficacy across populations. The moderate Brier score of around 0.3 highlighted existing predictive inaccuracies, emphasizing the necessity of fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy within the targeted demographics.

The simulation's core objective is to scrutinize the influence of modified variable correlations, derived from fixed NHANES dataset statistics, on the estimation of the Brier score for the target population. Utilizing a normal distribution approximation based on log-transformed mean and variance values, this exploration seeks to understand the impact of correlation variations on the Brier score estimation process. The methodology involves generating data using multivariate random sampling for log-transformed variables, considering distinct correlation settings (independence, low, moderate, high, and a Framingham-like pattern). Two sex-stratified logistic regression models predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) using specified variables, incorporating the computation of inverse-odds weights. The evaluation encompasses direct comparisons between estimated Brier scores and the NHANES dataset's original score to gauge correlation's influence on Brier score estimation accuracy.
